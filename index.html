        One year ago, black-clad youth of Hong Kong gathered outside parliament. Bricks and projectiles met rubber bullets and
        tear gas. Many protests and one pandemic later, the territory is facing another existential challenge. Will it survive?
        
        In the past 12 months, almost everyone in Hong Kong has worn a mask for one reason or another.
        
        For the protesters who fought pitched battles against police, it was a gas mask. For the peaceful demonstrators, it was
        a black face covering, to make a statement. For everyone else, it was a mask to protect against the pandemic sweeping
        the globe.
        
        Scarred by the memories of the 2003 Sars epidemic in the city, almost every Hong Konger donned a mask, and somehow the
        city came through relatively unscathed - even as the rest of the world was plunged into sickness and crisis.
        
        Then China made an announcement.
        
        It planned to impose a national security law - one that would make crimes of what it called "subversion, secession,
        terrorism and foreign interference". The law is being drafted and is likely to be approved this month.
        
        For the many critics of the proposed law, it is tantamount to making a crime of free speech, protest and dissent - and
        could mean the end of the unique freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong when it was handed over to China in 1997.
        
        "Hong Kong has entered a new stage. After what happened in the past year, Hong Kong could become totally different in
        the future," said Alice Cheung, a former student leader.
        
        It has been a year of disbelief and mental exhaustion for Ms Cheung. She could not have imagined what her hometown would
        go through - and the many masks she would have to wear. Like many in the city - on all sides of the argument - her fear
        for the future is real and raw.
